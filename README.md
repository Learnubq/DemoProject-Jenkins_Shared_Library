## Project Description

**A Jenkins Shared Library to extract common build logic**

1. I created a separate Git repository for the Jenkins Shared Library project.
2. I created functions in the JSL to use in the Jenkins pipeline.
3. I integrated and used the JSL in the Jenkins pipeline (globally and for a specific project in the Jenkinsfile).


**I have included a .md file (markdown file) to specify the Bash CLI commands and steps used to carry out specific tasks in the project.**

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank Nana and TWN for the opportunity to delve into the world of DevOps engineering through the TWN DevOps Bootcamp. Nana's approach to teaching is very effective and I feel concepts are introduced with the right amount of depth, whilst ensuring you are not overwhelmed with technical jargon, techniques, or tools. She has made a task that initially felt like a mountain to climb without directions, straightforward. I no longer had to worry about whether I was learning the correct concepts or missing out on any important information or skills. Thanks TWN!
